# Creating APIs with Laravel

![Api flow](api_flow.jpeg)


## Introduction

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to create APIs using Laravel, a popular PHP framework. Follow these instructions to set up a Laravel project, define models, create controllers, and implement API endpoints.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Setup Laravel Base Project

Start by creating a new Laravel project using Composer:


### 2. Create Model, Factory, Form Requests, Migration, Policy, and Resource Controller

Run the following Artisan command to create a `Task` model along with its associated factory, form requests, migration, policy, and resource controller:


### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Add database connection details to your `.env` file for seamless database connectivity.

### 4. Define Task Table Structure

Define the structure of the `tasks` table and its columns along with their data types in the migration file `database/migrations/YYYY_MM_DD_202422_create_tasks_table.php`.

### 5. Define Factory for Fake Data Generation

Define a factory for generating fake data for the `Task` model. This factory will be used to seed the database with sample data. Define fake data types in the `database/factories/TaskFactory.php` file.

### 6. Add Factory Migration to Seeders

Include the factory migration in the seeders file to ensure that fake data is added to the database during migration.

### 7. Run Migrations

Execute the migration to create the `tasks` table in the database and seed it with fake data:


### 8. Create API Endpoints

Define your API endpoints by creating functions in the TaskController. For example, you can return all task data in the `index()` function. Register API route resources in the `routes/api.php` file to map endpoints to controller functions.

Now, you can use tools like Postman to test and fetch data from your API endpoints.

## Conclusion

This README provides a comprehensive guide on setting up a Laravel API project and creating endpoints to interact with your application's data. Follow these steps to get started with building powerful APIs using Laravel.
